### Sample FAQ Entry:

```html
<div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
  <h3 itemprop="name">How often should dryer vents be cleaned?</h3>
  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <p itemprop="text">Dryer vents should be professionally cleaned at least once 
    per year for most households. However, families who do more than 8 loads per 
    week, homes with pets, or properties with longer vent runs (over 15 feet) 
    should consider cleaning every 6-9 months. Warning signs you need immediate 
    cleaning include clothes taking multiple cycles to dry, excessive heat in 
    the laundry room, burning smells, or visible lint around the dryer. In Reno's 
    dry climate, lint accumulates faster due to static electricity, making annual 
    cleaning essential for fire prevention.</p>
